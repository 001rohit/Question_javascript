
// Here are 20 if-else questions in JavaScript:

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable x is greater than 10. If it is, log "x is greater than 10" to the console. Otherwise, log "x is not greater than 10".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable y is equal to 0. If it is, log "y is zero" to the console. Otherwise, log "y is not zero".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable z is a positive number. If it is, log "z is positive" to the console. Otherwise, log "z is not positive".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable a is an even number. If it is, log "a is even" to the console. Otherwise, log "a is odd".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable b is divisible by 3. If it is, log "b is divisible by 3" to the console. Otherwise, log "b is not divisible by 3".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable c is a string. If it is, log "c is a string" to the console. Otherwise, log "c is not a string".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable d is null. If it is, log "d is null" to the console. Otherwise, log "d is not null".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable e is undefined. If it is, log "e is undefined" to the console. Otherwise, log "e is defined".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable f is a boolean. If it is, log "f is a boolean" to the console. Otherwise, log "f is not a boolean".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable g is NaN. If it is, log "g is NaN" to the console. Otherwise, log "g is not NaN".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable h is a function. If it is, log "h is a function" to the console. Otherwise, log "h is not a function".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable i is an object. If it is, log "i is an object" to the console. Otherwise, log "i is not an object".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable j is truthy. If it is, log "j is truthy" to the console. Otherwise, log "j is falsy".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable k is falsy. If it is, log "k is falsy" to the console. Otherwise, log "k is truthy".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable l is equal to another variable m. If it is, log "l is equal to m" to the console. Otherwise, log "l is not equal to m".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable n is greater than or equal to another variable o. If it is, log "n is greater than or equal to o" to the console. Otherwise, log "n is less than o".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable p is less than or equal to another variable q. If it is, log "p is less than or equal to q" to the console. Otherwise, log "p is greater than q".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable r is between two values s and t (inclusive). If it is, log "r is between s and t" to the console. Otherwise, log "r is not between s and t".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable u is a multiple of another variable v. If it is, log "u is a multiple of v" to the console. Otherwise, log "u is not a multiple of v".

// Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable w is a prime number. If it is, log "w is a prime number" to the console. Otherwise, log "w is not a prime number".
